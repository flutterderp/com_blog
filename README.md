# Blog Articles Component
A fork of Joomla 3's com_content component, created for use in situations where a client (or developer) may want the core content component's functionality with some customisations (i.e. multiple categories).

### Features
* Multiple categories â€“ allows users to associate articles with more than one category (main category field is still used for SEF URL purposes)
